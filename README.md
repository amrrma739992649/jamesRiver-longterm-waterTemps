# Long-term Water Temperature in the James River

![](waterTemps_benchmarkLines.gif)

A project to to combine 15 years of water quality monitoring data and generate daily mean summary statistics for select variables, as well as produce an animated plot depicting seasonal patterns and inter-annual variation in water temperature at VCU's Rice River Center monitoring station, located in the upper estuarine portion of the James River. This work was completed in collaboration with [Dr. Paul Bukaveckas](https://blogs.vcu.edu/pabukaveckas/) of VCU's Center for Environmental Studies.

**variables examined**
* Temperature (`TempC`)
* pH (`pH`)
* Specific Conductance (`SpCond_uScm`)
* Turbidity (`turb_NTU`)
* Chlorophyll a (`Chla`)
* Oxygen Dissolved Saturation (`ODOsat`)
* Oxygen Dissolved (mg/L) (`ODOmgl`)
